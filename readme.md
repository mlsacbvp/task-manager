## The Folder Structure

## A Brief Overview

This task managing application is based on The Kanban System Developed by Taiichi Ohno to improve manufacturing efficiency. 

**What is a Kanban Board?**

Imagine a whiteboard, divided into vertical lanes. Each lane represents a step in your process, from “To Do,” to “Doing,” to “Done.”

In Kanban, work always begins on the left side of the board, and works its way to the right: The far left lane typically holds work items that have not been started, and the far right lane holds work items that have been completed.

In addition to visualizing the steps in your process, Kanban boards can also provide visibility into other information about your work, such as process policies (rules for using the board), and work-in-process (WIP) limits.
